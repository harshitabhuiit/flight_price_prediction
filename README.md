# Flight Price Prediction
## Overview
Flight prices are highly dynamic, influenced by factors like seasonality, demand, booking time, and airline policies. This project aims to use data analysis and machine learning to predict flight price trends, helping travelers identify the best times to book flights and save money. By analyzing data and key pricing factors, we aim to build accurate predictive models to enhance trip planning for individuals and travel-related businesses.
## Features
- Analyze historical flight pricing data.
- Identify key factors influencing ticket prices.
- Build machine learning models to predict future prices.
- Provide actionable insights for cost-effective travel planning.
## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Modeling: Regression and classification models
## Steps
- ### Data Collection and Cleaning  
- Import the dataset containing flight price information.  
- Address missing data, remove any duplicate entries, and apply necessary changes to make the data clean and usable.  

### Descriptive Statistics  
- Compute basic statistics like average (mean), middle value (median), most common value (mode), spread (variance), and consistency (standard deviation) for important numerical columns.  

### Data Visualization  
- Create visual graphs like histograms, box plots, and bar charts to see how numerical data is distributed and how categorical and numerical data are related.  

### Geographical Insights  
- Use maps or heatmaps to visualize how flight prices vary by location.  
- Highlight areas with the most flights and the biggest price differences.

### Building Prediction Models  
- Create machine learning models to predict flight prices using historical data and important features.  
- Measure the accuracy of the models with suitable evaluation methods.  

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as departure date, airline, ticket class, and pricing history. Use publicly available datasets or scrape flight information (ensure compliance with data usage policies).I am using dataset from kaggle.

## Conclusion  
This project helps predict flight prices using data analysis and machine learning, making travel planning more cost-effective.
