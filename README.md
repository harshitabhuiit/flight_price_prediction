Flight prices are highly dynamic, influenced by factors like seasonality, demand, booking time, and airline policies. This project aims to use data analysis and machine learning to predict flight price trends, helping travelers identify the best times to book flights and save money. By analyzing data and key pricing factors, we aim to build accurate predictive models to enhance trip planning for individuals and travel-related businesses.
